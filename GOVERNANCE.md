# Project Governance

This document outlines the governance model for the UOR-Foundation/mcp project. It describes how decisions are made, how contributors can become maintainers, and how the project is managed.

## Project Structure

The UOR-Foundation/mcp project is maintained by the UOR Foundation and a community of contributors. The project is structured as follows:

### Roles

- **Users**: People who use the UOR-MCP implementation in their projects.
- **Contributors**: People who contribute code, documentation, or other artifacts to the project.
- **Maintainers**: People who have commit access to the repository and are responsible for reviewing and merging pull requests.
- **Core Team**: A subset of maintainers who are responsible for the overall direction of the project.

### Core Team

The Core Team is responsible for:

- Setting the overall direction of the project
- Making decisions when consensus cannot be reached
- Appointing new maintainers
- Resolving conflicts
- Ensuring the project adheres to its code of conduct

Current Core Team members:

- UOR Foundation Team (contact@uor.foundation)

## Decision Making

The UOR-Foundation/mcp project uses a consensus-based decision-making process. Decisions are made as follows:

1. **Proposals**: Anyone can propose changes to the project by opening an issue or pull request.
2. **Discussion**: The community discusses the proposal and provides feedback.
3. **Consensus**: If there is consensus among the maintainers, the proposal is accepted.
4. **Voting**: If consensus cannot be reached, the Core Team may call for a vote.

### Voting

When a vote is called, the following rules apply:

- Each Core Team member gets one vote.
- A simple majority (more than 50%) is required for most decisions.
- Major decisions (e.g., changing the governance model) require a two-thirds majority.
- Votes are cast by commenting on the relevant issue or pull request.

## Becoming a Maintainer

Contributors who have made significant and valuable contributions to the project may be invited to become maintainers. The process is as follows:

1. A contributor is nominated by an existing maintainer.
2. The Core Team discusses the nomination.
3. If there is consensus, the contributor is invited to become a maintainer.
4. The new maintainer is granted commit access to the repository.

Maintainers are expected to:

- Review pull requests in a timely manner
- Help contributors improve their submissions
- Participate in discussions about the project
- Adhere to the code of conduct
- Represent the project in a professional manner

## Code of Conduct

All participants in the UOR-Foundation/mcp project are expected to adhere to the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations of the Code of Conduct may result in removal from the project.

## Changes to Governance

Changes to this governance model may be proposed by opening an issue or pull request. Major changes require a two-thirds majority vote of the Core Team.
