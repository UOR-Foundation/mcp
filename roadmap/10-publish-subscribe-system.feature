Feature: UORDB Publish/Subscribe Message Bus
  As a UOR-MCP developer
  I want to implement a publish/subscribe system based on UORDB
  So that content changes can be propagated across the system

  Background:
    Given the UOR core implementation is complete
    And users have uordb repositories

  Scenario: Event Definition Structure
    When I define the UOR event structure
    Then events should be UOR objects with canonical representation
    And events should include publisher information
    And events should include event type and metadata
    And events should have a timestamp and unique identifier

  Scenario: Publication Channel Implementation
    When I implement publication channels
    Then channels should be categorized by content type and namespace
    And channels should support both public and private publications
    And channels should maintain event order
    And channels should handle high-volume publications efficiently

  Scenario: Subscription Management
    When I implement subscription management
    Then users should be able to subscribe to specific channels
    And subscriptions should be stored in the user's uordb repository
    And subscription criteria should support pattern matching
    And subscriptions should include permission validation

  Scenario: Event Delivery System
    When I implement the event delivery system
    Then events should be delivered to all valid subscribers
    And delivery should be attempted with appropriate retry logic
    And delivery status should be tracked
    And failed deliveries should be handled gracefully

  Scenario: Cross-Namespace Event Propagation
    When events are published across namespaces
    Then namespace resolution should be applied to event routing
    And events should maintain their canonical form across namespaces
    And circular publication routes should be detected and prevented
    And cross-namespace permissions should be enforced
