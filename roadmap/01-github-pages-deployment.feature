Feature: GitHub Pages Deployment [COMPLETED]
  As a UOR-MCP implementer
  I want to deploy the MCP server to GitHub Pages
  So that it can be accessed publicly without dedicated server infrastructure

  Background:
    Given the MCP implementation codebase exists in the repository
    And the repository is configured for GitHub Pages

  Scenario: Static Asset Configuration [COMPLETED]
    When I configure the build process for GitHub Pages
    Then the public directory should be set as the publishing source
    And all necessary static assets should be included in the build
    # Completed: public directory structure with all necessary static files is in place
    # and the build process in package.json is configured for GitHub Pages deployment

  Scenario: Client-Side Configuration [COMPLETED]
    When I implement client-side configuration for the MCP server
    Then the application should load configuration from environment variables or URL parameters
    And default configuration values should be provided for GitHub Pages environment
    # Completed: config.js implements robust loading from localStorage and URL parameters
    # with appropriate defaults for GitHub Pages environment

  Scenario: GitHub API Integration for Static Hosting [COMPLETED]
    When I implement the GitHub API client for static hosting
    Then the client should use client-side authentication
    And all API calls should work from a static hosting environment
    And CORS should be properly configured for GitHub API access
    # Completed: app.js implements GitHub client with OAuth flow for authentication
    # and properly formatted API calls for static hosting environment

  Scenario: Service Worker Implementation [COMPLETED]
    When I implement a service worker
    Then the service worker should enable offline functionality
    And the service worker should handle caching of essential resources
    And the service worker should manage GitHub API authentication state
    # Completed: service-worker.js implements caching and offline functionality
    # with appropriate handling of API requests and authentication state
