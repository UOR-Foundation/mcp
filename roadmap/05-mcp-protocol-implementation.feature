Feature: MCP Protocol Implementation
  As a UOR-MCP user
  I want the MCP server to implement the MCP protocol
  So that MCP-compatible clients can interact with UOR data

  Background:
    Given the MCP server is deployed
    And the UOR core implementation is complete

  Scenario: JSON-RPC 2.0 Endpoint
    When I implement the MCP protocol endpoint
    Then it should accept JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted requests
    And it should return JSON-RPC 2.0 formatted responses
    And it should handle batch requests efficiently
    And it should validate requests against the MCP specification

  Scenario: Initialize Method Implementation
    When I implement the initialize method
    Then it should return the server capabilities
    And it should include UOR-specific capabilities
    And it should provide instructions for UOR operations
    And it should establish the protocol version compatibility

  Scenario: Tools List Method Implementation
    When I implement the tools/list method
    Then it should return all available UOR tools
    And each tool should include a schema definition
    And the tools should include UOR-specific operations
    And the response should conform to the MCP specification

  Scenario: Resources List Method Implementation
    When I implement the resources/list method
    Then it should return all available UOR resource types
    And resources should be categorized by UOR type
    And resource URIs should follow the uor:// scheme
    And the response should include namespace information

  Scenario: Tool Execution Implementation
    When I implement tool execution
    Then tools should operate on UOR objects
    And tools should maintain trilateral coherence
    And tools should work with the GitHub-based storage
    And tool results should be returned in MCP-compatible format
