Feature: UOR Schema Integration
  As a UOR-MCP developer
  I want to integrate the UOR schemas from models/schemas
  So that the implementation adheres to UOR principles

  Background:
    Given the UOR schemas exist in the models/schemas directory

  Scenario: Schema Loading System
    When I implement the schema loading system
    Then it should load schemas from the models/schemas directory
    And the schemas should be parsed into usable TypeScript interfaces
    And schema references should be properly resolved
    And the system should handle schema validation

  Scenario: UOR Core Schema Integration
    When I integrate the UOR core schema
    Then the implementation should conform to the core UOR structure
    And UOR objects should match the schema definition
    And prime decomposition should follow the schema constraints
    And canonical representations should satisfy schema requirements

  Scenario: Axiom Schema Integration
    When I integrate the UOR axiom schemas
    Then the implementation should enforce trilateral coherence
    And it should ensure unique factorization
    And it should maintain canonical representations
    And it should preserve coherence measures

  Scenario: Observer Frame Schema Integration
    When I integrate the observer frame schema
    Then the implementation should support different observer perspectives
    And frame transformations should follow schema rules
    And invariant properties should be preserved
    And observer-specific views should be consistent with the schema

  Scenario: Schema Validation System
    When I implement schema validation
    Then all UOR objects should be validated against their schemas
    And validation errors should be reported clearly
    And the validation should prevent creation of invalid objects
    And the validation system should be extensible for custom schemas
