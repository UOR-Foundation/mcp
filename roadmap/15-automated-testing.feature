Feature: Automated Testing Implementation
  As a UOR-MCP developer
  I want comprehensive automated tests
  So that I can ensure the system works correctly

  Background:
    Given the UOR-MCP implementation is in progress

  Scenario: Unit Test Implementation
    When I implement unit tests
    Then each component should have associated unit tests
    And tests should verify component behavior in isolation
    And tests should cover normal and error paths
    And tests should run automatically in CI/CD pipelines

  Scenario: Integration Test Implementation
    When I implement integration tests
    Then tests should verify interactions between components
    And tests should cover key user workflows
    And tests should use mock GitHub and IPFS services
    And tests should verify data integrity across operations

  Scenario: UOR Coherence Verification Tests
    When I implement UOR coherence tests
    Then tests should verify trilateral coherence is maintained
    And tests should confirm canonical representations are correct
    And tests should validate prime decompositions
    And tests should check observer frame transformations

  Scenario: MCP Protocol Conformance Tests
    When I implement MCP protocol tests
    Then tests should verify conformance to the MCP specification
    And tests should cover all required protocol methods
    And tests should validate request and response formats
    And tests should check proper error handling

  Scenario: E2E Testing With GitHub Pages
    When I implement end-to-end tests
    Then tests should verify deployment to GitHub Pages
    And tests should check client-side functionality
    And tests should validate GitHub API integration
    And tests should confirm proper authentication flows
