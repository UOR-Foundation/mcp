# UOR-MCP Implementation Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the path to a complete MCP server implementation following UOR framework principles. Each feature file describes an atomic unit of functionality needed to achieve a pragmatic yet complete implementation that adheres to UOR principles.

## Core Implementation Features

1. [GitHub Pages Deployment](./01-github-pages-deployment.feature) - Configure the MCP server for deployment on GitHub Pages
2. [UOR Core Implementation](./02-uor-core-implementation.feature) - Implement the foundational UOR abstractions
3. [GitHub Authentication](./03-github-authentication.feature) - Implement GitHub OAuth for user authentication
4. [UORDB Repository](./04-uordb-repository.feature) - Create and manage user UORDB repositories
5. [MCP Protocol Implementation](./05-mcp-protocol-implementation.feature) - Implement the MCP protocol endpoints

## Core Functionality Features

6. [UOR Namespace Resolution](./06-uor-namespace-resolution.feature) - Implement cross-namespace resolution
7. [User Identity and Profile](./07-user-identity-profile.feature) - Manage user identity and profiles
8. [User Content Management](./08-user-content-management.feature) - Create and manage user content
9. [User Messaging](./09-user-messaging.feature) - Implement user-to-user messaging
10. [Publish/Subscribe System](./10-publish-subscribe-system.feature) - Create UORDB-based pub/sub system

## Extension Features

11. [IPFS Integration](./11-ipfs-integration.feature) - Add IPFS as an alternative storage provider
12. [Prime Decomposition Algorithms](./12-prime-decomposition-algorithms.feature) - Implement algorithms for different data types
13. [User Interface Implementation](./13-user-interface-implementation.feature) - Create a usable front-end interface
14. [Schema Integration](./14-schema-integration.feature) - Integrate UOR schemas from models/schemas
15. [Automated Testing](./15-automated-testing.feature) - Implement comprehensive testing

## Implementation Principles

This roadmap follows several key principles:

1. **UOR Compatibility**: All features adhere to UOR framework concepts, maintaining trilateral coherence between objects, representations, and observers.

2. **Pragmatic First Principles**: Features are designed to be atomic, buildable, and focused on the essential functionality.

3. **GitHub Pages Deployability**: The implementation prioritizes features that work within GitHub Pages constraints.

4. **Open Standards**: The implementation uses open standards where compatible with UOR principles.

5. **User-Centric**: Features include user identity, messaging, and content management early in the roadmap.

6. **Decentralized Architecture**: The system uses GitHub repositories and optionally IPFS for storage, with a publish/subscribe system built on UORDB.

## Manifestation Path

Following UOR terminology, this roadmap represents a "manifestation path" - an ordered sequence for bringing the discrete manifolds of the UOR-MCP implementation into existence. Each feature builds upon previous ones, creating a coherent and complete system that faithfully implements the UOR framework while remaining practical and deployable.
