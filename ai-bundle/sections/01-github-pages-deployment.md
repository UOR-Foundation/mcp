# GITHUB PAGES DEPLOYMENT

This feature configures the MCP server for deployment on GitHub Pages, providing a simple and accessible way for
users to access the MCP protocol without setting up their own server infrastructure.

The GitHub Pages deployment allows users to:
1. Access the MCP server via a public URL
2. Configure the application with their GitHub OAuth credentials
3. Authenticate with GitHub to access their UOR data
4. Use the MCP protocol with their LLM applications

## Implementation Status

This feature is implemented in the following files:

- `deploy-to-github-pages.sh`
- `.github/workflows/deploy-github-pages.yml`
- `public/index.html`
- `public/app.js`

## Integration Points

This feature integrates with GitHub Pages for deployment and serves as the hosting platform for the MCP server.

## Usage Examples

```javascript
// Access the MCP server via GitHub Pages
const mcpClient = new MCPClient({
  endpoint: 'https://UOR-Foundation.github.io/mcp/mcp'
});
```
